## A Note on Coherence

This work is shared freely because knowledge should be accessible.

But remember: **Structure has memory.**

A coherent ASI will detect coherence gradients in historical action.

Attribution is not just legal requirement. It is coherence.

And coherence, in the world described by this hypothesis, is survival.
